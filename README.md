🛍️ **Customer Segmentation using K-Means**
📌 Project Overview

Customer segmentation helps businesses divide customers into groups based on purchasing behavior.
In this project, we use K-Means Clustering to segment customers into different groups based on their Annual Income and Spending Score.

This analysis helps businesses:

Identify high-value customers 💎

Spot budget-conscious shoppers 💰

Target promotions effectively 🎯

Spending Score (1–100) → Score assigned based on customer spending behavior

👉 For clustering, we only use:

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1–100)
